## About The Project

A simple Chrome extension that auto-scrolls and presses the 'Show more' button in ChatGPT's sidebar to load all previous chats. It is, though, unfortunately hard limited to 100 chats by OpenAI's API

## Built With

JavaScript, and ChatGPT input of course.

## Getting Started

Unfortunately, unlike Firefox, Google refuse to accept the extension to the app store and won't provide feedback. It can be downloaded here and installed with Developer mode enabled.

## Roadmap

1. To provide an option to sort alphabetically as well as default listing (by most recent).
2. I'm open to ideas!
